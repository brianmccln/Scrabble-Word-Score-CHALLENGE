## Scrabble Word Scorer  

#### User Interface / User Experience:  
- User types a word in the input box
- Score appears below in the h2

#### HTML : DONE  
#### CSS : DONE  
#### JavaScript : YOU DO

#### The challenge if for you to write the JS  
that makes the word score appear when the user  
enters a word and hits Enter.  
There is no Submit button, because this is an input  
box of type **'search'**, which means it has a  
**'search' event** that runs when you hit the Enter key.  
You need to make the 'search' event call a function  
that calculates and outputs the Scrabble score for the  
entered word. If just gibberish is entered, or if the word  
is too long, the output should say so.  

#### First things first: Come up with an Alorithm:  
- Inspect the two datasets carefully:  
- **dictionary.js** contains an array of all 180K Scrabble words  
- **letter-values.js** contains an object of 26 letter-value pairs   
You need to figure out how to use these datasets in your code? 
- Write out what the program need to do, step-by-step.  
- Your Algo should read like an outline, like a to-do list  
- Then fill in with code, so the notes become code comments  
- Test your progress by logging to the console frequently.
